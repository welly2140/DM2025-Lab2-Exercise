So then, uh, what is the characteristic about, uh, uh, about data matrix data set? First, you need to know they are consist of numerical value. So, they can be tabular format. And then they usually in this table form. So we call them tabular formats. And they don't have unstructured data. They don't. They will not have unstructured data. And they can utilize a lot of statistic method and machine learning way to working with that. If you took machine learning course, usually they assume the data already been convert into data matrix. They usually consider about that. So a lot of machine learning are starting from matrix operation. So then because of it, your data need to go through the preprocessing to convert them to corresponding data matrix. But what about the document data? Then they are not structured data. They can contain the paragraph, sentence and word. In order for you to convert them to a matrix side, but then originally they are paragraph and the sentence and word. And then they might need some, uh, natural language processing technique for you to convert them. And like after 2013, we have large language model, we can utilize that way to convert it. And then we usually before 2013, people try to talking about then it's called information retrieval. So you need some text analysis, try to working with that. And that is difference between the document and data and data matrix data.",

So for example, you went to 7-11, you purchase certain item. And those item will be kept in one transaction. And why we call them transaction is because how the item appear in the transaction. We don't care about the order. So the bread, Coke, milk, if you do milk, Coke, Coke and bread, they are the same. Okay, so then we don't care about order in transaction.",

Uh, if you interested in there, you actually can, uh, you can took some courses, like the, uh, graph network, thing like that. And then we're talking so much about how to working with that. Okay.
