      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

      "### Formal Definition\n",
      "\n",
      "**Data Mining** is the process of discovering patterns, correlations, anomalies, and other valuable information from large datasets (often called \"Big Data\"). It uses a combination of machine learning, statistics, and database systems to transform raw data into understandable and usable knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key goal is not just to extract data, but to extract *insight*. It's about asking questions you didn't even know you had and letting the data reveal the answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Data Mining Process\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining isn't a single step; it's a structured process. The most widely accepted model is called **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), which has six main phases:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Business Understanding:** What is the problem we are trying to solve? What does the business want to achieve? (e.g., \"We want to reduce customer churn by 15%.\")\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** What data do we have? Is it clean? Is it relevant? This involves exploring the dataset to get familiar with its properties.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation:** This is often the most time-consuming step (taking up to 80% of the project time). It involves cleaning the data (handling missing values, correcting errors), combining data from different sources, and formatting it for analysis.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** This is where the \"magic\" happens. Data scientists apply various algorithms and techniques (see below) to the prepared data to find patterns.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Are the patterns and models we found actually useful and accurate? Do they help solve the business problem defined in step 1? The results are tested and validated.\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** The discovered knowledge is put into action. This could be a new feature in an app (like a recommendation engine), a report for management, or an automated system for detecting fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Common Data Mining Techniques\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some of the most common tasks and techniques used in data mining:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Classification\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Assigning items to predefined categories or classes.\n",
      "*   **Example:** An email service classifying an incoming email as either \"Spam\" or \"Not Spam.\" A bank deciding whether to approve or deny a loan application.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Regression\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (like a price, temperature, or sales figure).\n",
      "*   **Example:** Predicting the price of a house based on its size, location, and number of bedrooms. Forecasting a company's sales for the next quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Clustering\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Grouping similar items together into \"clusters\" without any predefined labels. The algorithm finds the natural groupings in the data.\n",
      "*   **Example:** A marketing team grouping customers into different segments (e.g., \"high-spenders,\" \"budget-shoppers,\" \"new customers\") based on their purchasing behavior to create targeted campaigns.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Association Rule Mining (Market Basket Analysis)\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Discovering relationships between items in a large dataset. It's famous for finding \"if-then\" rules.\n",
      "*   **Classic Example:** A supermarket discovers that customers who buy diapers are also very likely to buy beer. This insight could lead them to place beer near the diaper aisle to increase sales. This is the origin of the phrase \"beer and diapers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection)\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Identifying data points or events that are unusual and don't fit with the rest of the data.\n",
      "*   **Example:** A credit card company detecting fraudulent transactions by flagging purchases that are completely out of character for a customer (e.g., a large purchase in a foreign country).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 6. Sequential Pattern Mining\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Discovering patterns that happen in a specific order over time.\n",
      "*   **Example:** An online retailer finds that customers who buy a smartphone are 70% likely to buy a screen protector within the next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Real-World Examples\n",
      "\n",
      "You interact with the results of data mining every day:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Netflix & Spotify:** Their recommendation engines analyze your viewing/listening history and compare it to millions of other users to suggest what you might like next.\n",
      "*   **Amazon:** The \"Customers who bought this item also bought...\" feature is a classic example of association rule mining.\n",
      "*   **Finance:** Banks use data mining to assess credit risk (credit scoring) and detect fraudulent activity in real-time.\n",
      "*   **Healthcare:** Researchers mine medical data to find patterns that can help predict diseases, identify effective treatments, and manage hospital resources.\n",
      "*   **Marketing:** Companies use it to predict which customers are likely to stop using their service (customer churn) so they can offer them incentives to stay.\n",

      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving its essential information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns.\n",

      "*   **Sequential Pattern Mining:** Discovering patterns of events that occur in a specific order (e.g., analyzing website clickstream data to understand user navigation paths).\n",
      "*   **Text Mining:** Extracting information and insights from unstructured text data (e.g., sentiment analysis of customer reviews, topic modeling of documents).\n",

      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Underlying Technology \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n",

      "\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development. The techniques used to train LLMs, such as deep learning and neural networks, are core machine learning concepts. Therefore, LLMs are a specific, advanced type of machine learning model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t\t In essence, machine learning is the field of study and the set of techniques. LLMs are a powerful manifestation of these techniques. Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
